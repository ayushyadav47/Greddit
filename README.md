# Greddit
Web Application using MERN Stack

A clone of Reddit is made for the course Design and Analysis of Software Systems. The App is built with MERN stack. 

The application has been dockerised an wrapped in an nginx server. To fire up the whole stack run:

for running backend
```
cd backend
npm run server
```

for running frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm init
npm start
```

This will start the website on 3000 port on your browser.
